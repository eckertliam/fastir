# FastIR

ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress. ðŸš§

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build off of my work on [InlineML](https://github.com/eckertliam/inline-ml.git) and create a data driven LLVM IR super optimizer. Working on InlineML, I was able to create a classifier for inlining that with very little data could replicate LLVM's inlining decisions. I believe that with terabytes of data instead of gigabytes LLVM's optimization passes could be hyper optimized.
